Anthony's Dotfiles
==================

This repository contains all of my dotfiles. They're not guarenteed to be
perfect, nor are they guarenteed to work on your machine, but they do the job 
for me!

Notes:
------
At the time of writing this I'm using an Ubuntu base system with the i3 
window manager on top of it. I have started using ZSH (with Powerline) as my 
shell enviornment. Lastly I am trying to get a bit better at VIM, although I 
haven't properly customised it yet!

Usage:
------

All files are restored using GNU Stow with the install script, used as follows:
```
./install.sh
```
(It's pretty simple isn't it?)
